# Python Internship Assignments - Basic Data Processing Systems

## Project Overview

This repository contains beginner-level Python programs developed as
part of an internship assignment.
The programs simulate real-world systems such as authentication,
academic evaluation, data cleaning, text validation, and log monitoring.

Each program demonstrates fundamental Python concepts including: -
Conditional statements - Loops - Lists and dictionaries - String
manipulation - Basic data analysis

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Assignments Included

### 1. User Login Check

Simulates a basic authentication system that verifies username and
password.

**Real-World Application:**\
Used in college portals, banking systems, and web applications for
secure login.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 2️. Pass / Fail Analyzer

Analyzes student marks and counts the number of passed and failed
students.

**Real-World Application:**\
Used in online examination portals and academic result systems.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 3️. Simple Data Cleaner

Cleans and standardizes user names by removing extra spaces and
converting text to lowercase.

**Real-World Application:**\
Used in data preprocessing before analysis in data analytics systems.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 4️. Message Length Analyzer

Analyzes message length and flags messages longer than a defined limit.

**Real-World Application:**
Used in chat applications and text validation systems.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 5️. Error Message Detector

Counts the number of "ERROR" entries in system logs.

**Real-World Application:**
Used in monitoring and log analysis systems in IT infrastructure.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
